/*Buffer to store huge amounts off data, where parts of it will not be used very often
  Holds a certain amount in memory (in a ringbuffer), but when this buffer comes within 20% of being filled,
  some data (till the buffer is 30% filled) will be pushed to HDD.
  If data outside of what is currently in the buffer is accessed, a memory area of 5% the size of the ringbuffer will be read into memory
  And stay there for 1 minute. The timeout will reset if something in that group is accessed again.
  The temporary allocated groups are kept in a sorted list together with their startindex(included) and endindex(included) and last time accessed. It's sorted after most recent access.
  a thread searches through the list every second and deallocates stuff which are timed out.
